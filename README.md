1. Real-Time Crowd Simulation
with Pathfinding (CUDA +
OpenCL + MPI)
Goal: Simulate thousands
of agents moving through a
complex environment using A* or
Dijkstra's algorithm in parallel.
• Use CUDA/OpenCL for local
pathfinding acceleration.
• Use MPI to divide the
environment into zones and sync
borders.
• Visualize the crowd flow in
real-time.
Interactive Twist: Let users draw
new obstacles or change crowd
goals mid-simulation.
